# Personal Dashboard - Chrome Extension

- Often wondered if there is chance to customize default dashboard of your browser beyond the options available?
- This is one of the solution I came up with which uses few free API services to pull information.
- This information is available when ever user opens a new tab
- The images are refreshed everytime a new tab is opened to enhance the user experience
- The screen contains:
  - Weather Data (Location and Temperature)
  - Crypto (Doge)
  - Picture info (Author and Location)
  - Time

### Tech used ‚öôÔ∏è

- HTML
- CSS
- Async JavaScript
